<!-- PROJECT INTRODUCTION -->
# Introduction
## 1.1 General Infos
Hoomie is an application build with VueJs & VuetifyJs. It aims to track your personal and(/or) group expenses, and to give you useful tools for your daily tasks (such as creating and editing shopping lists, managing a petty cash with your friends and so on). <br>
This project is the completion of my first learning experience of the VueJs & VuetifyJs foundamentals, so it might be confused and not properly optimized (some routing problems may appear. Furthermore groups dashboard queries could be improved, collecting them in a single parent component).
## 1.2 Hosting & Database
I used Firebase Hosting to host the project, a NoSQL Firestore DB to manage my datas and Firebase Auth to manage users' authentication.
